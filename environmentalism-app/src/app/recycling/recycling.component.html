          It takes one ton of sodas(aluminum) to save three tons of carbon dioxide.
          If you were trying to do the same thing with glass,
          it would require 9 tons.Reusing cardboard and paper is very beneficial
          because it is a lot more expensive to manufacture them.

        <p>Recycling glass and plastic is not very effective.
          This is because you end up wasting a lot of water to
          clean out your recyclables. Research shows that
          the time, labor, and machinery needed to prepare
          plastic and glass for recycling could double
          the value of resources required for putting them into a landfill.
